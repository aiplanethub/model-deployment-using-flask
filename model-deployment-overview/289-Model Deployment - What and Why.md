## Learning Objectives
* What is Model Deployment?
* Why Model Deployment?



### Imagine

* You have spent several weeks or months building a machine learning model that would identify if a person has put a mask on his/her face or not with a very good accuracy score.
* Sounds great, right? Is this all you wanted?
* No. Building a model is generally not the end of the project.
*You would want your model to be used in real time where it could identify people in parks, at bus stations, streets, etc. with no mask and immediately inform the people nearby to maintain sufficient distance.
* This is where model deployment comes into picture.


## What Is Model Deployment?

* The concept of deployment in data science refers to the application of a model for prediction using new data.
* In other words, when you use your trained ML model to make a prediction of new data available to users or other systems, it is called model deployment.
* In technical terms, model deployment means to integrate a machine learning model into an existing production environment where it can take in an input and return an output.

## Why Model Deployment?

* A machine learning model can begin to add value to an organization only when that model’s insight is timely available to the users for which it was built.
* Even if the aim of the model is to increase the knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained should be organized and presented in a way that a customer will use it.
* If you directly present the model’s code, the customers cannot
understand. You need to provide an user interface.
* To achieve this, you need to deploy the model on the web.
